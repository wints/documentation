## Welcome to your dashboard

You've created a link and integrated the SDK - now it's time to dive into your data with the [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io). One screenshot is worth a million... dollars on spent on poorly performing ads and expensive tools to track those ads:

## Dashboard tips

Here's some handy advice for getting the most out of your dashboard:

* Label your links by the proper `feature`, `campaign`, `channel` and `tags` so that you properly separate out different types of links and app versions from one another

* Set up [custom events](/recipes/advanced_referral_incentives/{{page.platform}}/#custom-events) to create [conversion funnels](/recipes/dashboard_pro_tips/{{page.platform}}/#funnels)

* See who your power users are by implementing [referral links](/recipes/referral_links_with_incentives/{{page.platform}}/) then viewing [data about your top users](/recipes/dashboard_pro_tips/{{page.platform}}/#influencers-your-best-users)

* Build your own services on top of Branch attribution data using our [webhook system](/recipes/webhooks_and_exporting_data/)
