When users click your links on desktop, they have the option to text themselves the app. We provide this by default--just [create a test marketing link](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/marketing) and click it on your computer. You can also use the [code on this page](/recipes/text_me_the_app_page/#sendsms-example) to create your own fully-branded text-me-the-app page. 

_**LEFT:** This default page is provided by Branch. **RIGHT:** This page was created by Drafted and can be viewed [here](http://drft.us/l/5Rfz8GU0yO)._

{% image src="/img/recipes/text_me_the_app/default_and_drafted.png" center alt="Default Page" %}

The two-step setup process is simple:

1. Visit the [Branch link configuration tool](https://start.branch.io/). For `Desktop URL`, enter the page on your site that will include a text-me-the-app option.
2. Use the customizable [code snippet below](/recipes/text_me_the_app_page/#sendsms-example) on any page(s) on your website to allow users to text themselves the app.

{% protip title="Supports international SMS" %}
Branch uses Twilio for our text-me-the-app feature. Thanks to Twilio, users can text themselves your app around the world!

## Web Setup

**TL;DR** -- You can skip to the [code snippet below](/recipes/text_me_the_app_page/#sendsms-example) to implement this feature immediately.

Add the following code somewhere inside the `<head> </head>` tags on your website. Be sure to replace `YOUR-BRANCH-KEY` with your Branch Key inside the `init()` call. You can find your Branch Key on the Dashboard's [Settings page](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings).

{% highlight html %}
<script type="text/javascript">
{% ingredient web_sdk/_initialization %}{% endingredient %}
function sendSMS(form) {
  branch.sendSMS(
    phone: form.phone.text,
    {
      channel: 'Website',
      feature: 'Text-Me-The-App',
      data: {
        foo: 'bar'
      }
    },
    { make_new_link: false }, // Default: false. If set to true, sendSMS will generate a new link even if one already exists.
    function(err) { console.log(err); }
  }
});
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

## FAQ

**Q: I've sent myself multiple texts just now and only received the first few, what's going on?** 

A: This occurs when a carrier filters you SMS out due to spam. We try our hardest to rate limit a specific user, however, if bypassed, carriers may block your SMS. The reason is that carriers will agressively block content if it's similar and repeatedly sent to the same number. The solution is to wait 24-48 hours.

**Q: How come my (non US) phone number isn't working?**

A: With full numbers, you are required to use the "+" and the country code. If you know your users are only in a certain country, you could automatically append the + and the country code so that they only need to append their number without the country code.
