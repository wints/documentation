Basic Branch Integration Guide for iOS
=========================

By the end of this guide, you will have walked through the integration steps of our demo app, [Branchsters for iOS](https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Branch-Monster-Factory).

The purpose of the app is to let a user create a completely custom monster by choosing the color, face, body and name. After settling on its unique features, the user then receives a Branch short link for that monster that can be shared on Facebook, Twitter, Email and SMS. When this link is clicked, if the clicking person doesn't have the app, they get taken to the app store. After installing the app, the new user sees the monster they had just clicked on (deep linked through the app store). If the clicking person has the app, the app opens immediately and the person sees the monster (regular deep link).

The demo app shows off the power of the links to point to specific content inside of an app. The links take the clicking person to the best possible experience, ensuring that they see the content (are deep linked) no matter if they have the app installed at first or not.
