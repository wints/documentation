#### Branch-provided data parameters in callback

Previously, Branch did not return any information to the app if `initSession` was called but the user hadn't clicked on a link. Now Branch returns explicit parameters every time. Here is a list, and a description of what each represents.

* `~` denotes analytics
* `+` denotes information added by Branch
* (for the curious, `$` denotes reserved keywords used for controlling how the Branch service behaves)


| **Parameter** | **Meaning**
| ~channel | The channel on which the link was shared, specified at link creation time
| ~feature | The feature, such as `invite` or `share`, specified at link creation time
| ~tags | Any tags, specified at link creation time
| ~campaign | The campaign the link is associated with, specified at link creation time
| ~stage | The stage, specified at link creation time
| ~creation_source | Where the link was created ('API', 'Dashboard', 'SDK', 'iOS SDK', 'Android SDK', or 'Web SDK')
| +match_guaranteed | True or false as to whether the match was made with 100% accuracy
| +referrer | The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked
| +phone_number | The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app
| +is_first_session | Denotes whether this is the first session (install) or any other session (open)
