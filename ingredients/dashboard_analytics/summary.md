The Dashboard's [Summary](https://dashboard.branch.io/#) page is quite powerful. You can see:

* Total installs
* Time plot and pie chart: Branch-driven installs by feature, campaign, channel and tags over time
* Clicks, installs and opens by platform (desktop, Android, iOS), as well as by campaign, channel, etc.
* [Conversion funnels](/recipes/dashboard_pro_tips/#funnels)
